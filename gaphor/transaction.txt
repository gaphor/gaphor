Transaction support for Gaphor
==============================

Transaction support is located in module gaphor.transaction:

    >>> from gaphor import transaction
    >>> from gaphor.application import Application

Do some basic initialization, so event emission will work:

    >>> Application.init(services=['component_registry'])

The Transaction class is used mainly to signal the begin and end of a transaction. This is done by the TransactionBegin, TransactionCommit and TransactionRollback events:

    >>> from gaphor.core import event_handler
    >>> @event_handler(transaction.TransactionBegin)
    ... def transaction_begin_handler(event):
    ...     print 'tx begin'
    >>> component.provideHandler(transaction_begin_handler)

Same goes for commit and rollback events:

    >>> @event_handler(transaction.TransactionCommit)
    ... def transaction_commit_handler(event):
    ...     print 'tx commit'
    >>> component.provideHandler(transaction_commit_handler)
    >>> @event_handler(transaction.TransactionRollback)
    ... def transaction_rollback_handler(event):
    ...     print 'tx rollback'
    >>> component.provideHandler(transaction_rollback_handler)


A Transaction is started by initiating a Transaction instance:

    >>> tx = transaction.Transaction()
    tx begin

On success, a transaction can be committed:

    >>> tx.commit()
    tx commit

After a commit, a rollback is no longer allowed (the transaction is closed):

    >>> tx.rollback()
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TransactionError: No Transaction on stack.


Transactions may be nested:

    >>> tx = transaction.Transaction()
    tx begin
    >>> tx2 = transaction.Transaction()
    >>> tx2.commit()
    >>> tx.commit()
    tx commit

Transactions should be closed in the right order (subtransactions first):

    >>> tx = transaction.Transaction()
    tx begin
    >>> tx2 = transaction.Transaction()
    >>> tx.commit()
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TransactionError: Transaction on stack is not the transaction being closed.
    >>> tx2.commit()
    >>> tx.commit()
    tx commit


The transactional decorator can be used to mark functions as transactional:

    >>> @transaction.transactional
    ... def a():
    ...     print 'do something'
    >>> a()
    tx begin
    do something
    tx commit

If an exception is raised from within the decorated function a rollback is
performed:

    >>> @transaction.transactional
    ... def a():
    ...     raise IndexError, 'bla'
    >>> a()
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IndexError: bla
    >>> transaction.Transaction._stack
    []

All transactions are marked for rollback once an exception is raised:

    >>> tx = transaction.Transaction()
    tx begin
    >>> a()
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    IndexError: bla
    >>> tx._need_rollback
    True
    >>> tx.commit()
    tx rollback


Cleanup:

    >>> Application.shutdown()
