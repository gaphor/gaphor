"""Interface item implementation. There are several notations supported.

- class box with interface stereotype
- folded interface
    - ball is drawn to indicate provided interface
    - socket is drawn to indicate required interface

Interface item can act as icon of assembly connector, see
`gaphor.diagram.connector` module documentation for details. *Documentation
of this module does not take into account assembly connector icon mode.*

Folded Interface Item
=====================
Folded interface notation is reserved for very simple situations.
When interface is folded

- only an implementation can be connected (ball - provided interface)
- or only usage dependency can be connected (socket - required interface)

Above means that interface cannot be folded when

- both, usage dependency and implementation are connected
- any other lines are connected

Dependencies
------------
Dependencies between folded interfaces are *not supported*

+---------------------+---------------------+
|     *Supported*     |    *Unsupported*    |
+=====================+=====================+
| ::                  | ::                  |
|                     |                     |
|   |A|--(    O--|B|  |   |A|--(--->O--|B|  |
|        Z    Z       |        Z    Z       |
+---------------------+---------------------+

On above diagram, A requires interface Z and B provides interface Z.
Additionally, on the right diagram, Z is connected to itself with
dependency.

There is no need for additional dependency

- UML data model provides information, that Z is common for A and B
  (A requires Z, B provides Z)
- on a diagram, both folded interface items (required and provided)
  represent the same interface, which is easily identifiable with its name

Even more, adding a dependency between folded interfaces provides
information, on UML data model level, that an interface depends on itself
but, it is not the intention of this (*unsupported*) notation.

For more examples of non-supported by Gaphor notation, see
http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BallAndSocket.html.


Folding and Connecting
----------------------
Current approach to folding and connecting lines to an interface is as
follows

- allow folding/unfolding of an interface only when there is only one
  implementation or dependency usage connected
- when interface is folded, allow only one implementation or dependency
  usage to be connected

Folding and unfolding is performed by `InterfacePropertyPage` class.
