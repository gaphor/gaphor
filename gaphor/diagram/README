module: gaphor.diagram
======================

This module contains the items that can be placed in gaphor.UML.Diagram's.
Each diagram item represents one or more gaphor.UML.Element's (subclasses
thereof). Diagram items are subclassed from Presentation. This is the base
class for "presentation elements": items used to visualize an UML element.

Also gaphor.UML.Element is inherited. This class contains logic for event
notification among other utility functions (e.g. the __unlink__ signal).

Presentation elements ("items") have a "subject" attribute, that refers to the
(main-) model element class that is represented (e.g. a class representation
has as subject a gaphor.UML.Class instance, other elements, such as
gaphor.UML.Property and gaphor.UML.Operation are implicitly referenced.

Signal handling
---------------

As of this version, signal notification is done through zope.component. As a
result all modification events originated from gaphor.UML classes are received
by all items. (In the old days every item should register for specific events
on specific model elements, which resulted in quite a complex administration of
event handlers, since all those handlers should be unregistered when an item
was removed).

Connecting items
----------------

Another change, due to the introduction of the Zope3 framework, is how items
are connected to one another. This is done through adapters (multi-adapters to
be more specific). An adapter is used to add additional behavior to an object.
In this case the IConnect interface should be implemented for (element, line)
tuples. For each possible connection an adapter should be written (CommentItem
with any DiagramItem, AssociationItem with ClassifierItem, etc.). The big
(huge) advantage is that complex connection stuff is removed from the diagram
items (which resulted in cyclic dependencies in the past) and is put on a
higher level: the adapter.

See interfaces.py and adapter.py for implementations.

Text editing
------------

Like item connecting, text editing is also implemented through adapters. The Editor interface is used for this.
