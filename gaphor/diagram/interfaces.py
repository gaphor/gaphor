    Provide an interface for editing text with the TextEditTool.

        Is this item editable in it's current state.
        x, y represent the cursors (x, y) position.

        Get the bounding box of the (current) text. The edit tool is not
        required to do anything with this information but it might help for
        some nicer displaying of the text widget.
