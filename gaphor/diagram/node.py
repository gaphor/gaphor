Node item may represent a node or a device UML metamodel classes.

Grouping
========
Node item can group following items

- other nodes, which are represented with Node.nestedNode on UML metamodel
  level
- deployed artifacts using deployment
- components, which are parts of a node acting as structured classifier
  (nodes may have internal structures)

Node item grouping logic is implemented in `gaphor.adapters.grouping`
module.
