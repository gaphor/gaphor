    Line item ``line`` connects with a handle to a connectable item ``element``.

    - line: connecting item

    The following methods are required to make this work:

    - `allow()`: is the connection allowed at all (during mouse movement for example).
      
    - `connect()`: Establish a connection between element and line. Also takes care of
      disconnects, if required (e.g. 1:1 relationships)
    - `disconnect()`: Break connection, called when dropping a handle on a
       point where it can not connect.
    - `reconnect()`: Connect to another item (only used if present)
