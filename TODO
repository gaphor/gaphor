As always, there is much to do...

- Storing last open files or having a quick-list of most important
  directories or so would be great 
  Problem: the existing <Placeholder> stuff works only on constrcution time.
    For this we need a menu that can change during the life of the application.

- write really good test cases for undo functionality.

- confirmation window when creating a new model.

- An option that shows the selected item (in the namespace view) in a diagram.

- Copy/Paste for diagramitems

- How to figure out if a module exists without loading it?

- fix accelarators (HOW?), partially done, accelerators on items in popup menus
  does not work.
  Accelerators should be activated by the (Abstract)Window, should not depend
  on menu items

- Undo/redo functionality doesn't work as espected
  ==> Create our own UndoManager, this should also register connect/disconnect
  actions on gaphor.UML classes.

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI, code, images (SVG/png), etc. - make a plugin!

#- Make text selected when starting to edit it: fixed in DiaCanvas2

#- Stereotypes: check documentation page 581 (597 absolute). Fixed. An extra
   association has been created between Stereotype and Class, Interface and
   Package.

#- Set up a plugin architecture. Since the internals of gaphor are pretty
   modular, plugins should not be that hard. I'm very happy with the new one
   it is easy to program, yet powerful (due to the XML description file, which
   allows gaphor to check several dependencies upfront.

I also intend to "merge" lines (as is often used for generalizations: a line with one arrow, which splits into two lines, one for each subclass)

The text editing also needs a facelift.
