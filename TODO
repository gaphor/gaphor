As always, there is much to do...

- Storing last open files or having a quick-list of most important
  directories or so would be great 

- How to figure out if a module exists without loading it?

- fix accelarators (HOW?), partially done, accelerators on items in popup menus
  does not work.
  Accelerators should be activated by the window, should not depend on menu
  items

- Undo/redo functionality doesn;t work as espected

#- Make text selected when starting to edit it: fixed in DiaCanvas2

#- Stereotypes: check documentation page 581 (597 absolute). Fixed. An extra
   association has been created between Stereotype and Class, Interface and
   Package.

#- Class: Association end properties are shown in the tree view
#- Implement and test attribute/operation parser.
#- Convert Data model to use the parsed attributes + operations.
#- Operation is not part of namespace (assoc. should be bi-dir.)

#- Make sure than, when a model is loaded and saved again, both save files do
#  not differ.

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI, code, images (SVG/png), etc. - make a plugin!

#- Set up a plugin architecture. Since the internals of gaphor are pretty
   modular, plugins should not be that hard.

I also intend to "merge" lines (as is often used for generalizations: a line with one arrow, which splits into two lines, one for each subclass)

The text editing also needs a facelift.

Classes
-------
Classes have a makeup like this:
	+------------+
	|   <<st>>  o| stereotype: centered, icon: right justified.
	|  *class*   | class name, centered, bold
	+------------+
	|  *name*    | compartment name, centered, bold
	| + attr1    | attribute, operation or wharever
	+------------+
	| ...        |
	+------------+
- Create stereotype, so we can add them to classes.
- How to put things like multiplicity and visibility in a popup menu
- lose (not in a comment box) text


Stereotypes
-----------
Stereotypes is quite another story. In order to create a stereotype
one should create a Profile. Within this profile a Diagram can be created.
This diagram should accept only items that are useful within a profile:
- Classes, which will function as <<metaclass>>.
- Stereotype, which wil be the defined <<stereotypes>>.
- Extensions, connecting metaclasses and stereotypes.

and of course the usual: Comment, Association, Generalization and Dependency.

Thoughts:
- Profiles are reusable and its common to share them with different models.
- Stereotypes can only be owned by Profiles, not by (normal) Packages.
- We have to do a lookup if a MetaClass is actually part of the model.
- a stereotype can contain an image, that can be used in stead of its name
- Profiles should be saved with the model too. And iit should be possible to
  "update" a profile within a model.

Maybe it would be nice to create Stereotypes without creating the diagrams.
Via a dialog once can select which class (Operation, Class, etc.) is
stereotyped, which extra constraints apply and/or if you inherit from an
already existing stereotype. This way it's easy to save your stereotypes
apart from the model (and possibly in the model too) so they can be reused
in other models. 

I could create a special diagram window too that can be used to create
profiles. Profiles should be added to packages within the model.

This window should contain:
1. Name of the stereotype
2. Metaclass it applies to (Class, Operation, etc.)
3. If it is a subclass of an already existing metaclass
4. Constraints
5. Description
6. The profile it belongs to.

When a stereotype is used, an instance is created of the Stereotype
(meta)class. This is not really possible for our application. Gaphor should
figure out another way to do this. Should check XMI and see how they do it
(maybe a property is enough).

It looks like the stereotypes are more a concept than something that is
implementable in an application. The point is that the stereotypes you define
(instances of Stereotype) should be instantiated in your model when you create
a stereotyped class.

There is BTW no way to connect a stereotype with a class other than an
Association.
