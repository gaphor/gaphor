 - Undo functionality
 - Load / save regression testing
   !!! Create some example diagrams,

 - split DiagramItem in a stereotype support, SubjectSupport and some
   other support classes.

 - using stereotypes
 - associations
 - components and stuff

 - lot's of tests are dependent on a decently initialized main window.
   There is no need for these actions to depend on a main window, they only
   need a gaphas.View instance.

 - Use actions only for action definitions. use Events for notification
   between actions.

======== stereotypes branch =========

===== end of stereotypes branch =====

======= 0.8.0 ========
- load uml2.gaphor and open other file or split flows and undo/redo.
  exception is raised. seems to be related to diagram item unlinking.

======= End of 0.8.0 ========

As always, there is much to do...

- At this point we have three event systems:
   1. GObject - used by GTK+, should be restricted to the GUI
   2. Actions - used for (pseudo) menu actions (artifical actions are triggered
                some times (e.g. to notify about changes in the Undo Manager)
                works with string based notifiers.
   3. Zope - fairly optimized, works with interfaces and objects for a
             change.

   GObject will stay as long as we use GTK+. Restrict it's influence to the GUI.
   (to much management overhead)
   Actions work fine, for menu actions. Gaphor specific and should work
   with the GTK+ menu manager classes.
   Zope classes are quite optimized. However, mainly provides the same
   functionality as Actions, but not as fine grained.

- Check association removal when connected to a class.

- Add meta data (such as text alignment) to the model file (add a meta:
  namespace?)
.
- Fix namespace relations between Lifeline and Interaction and Message and
  Interaction

- Allow to make Action objects, instead of defining classes.
  Should use meta-classes for registration too (define __abstract__ or\something to prevent registration).

#- Store application state:
  #- last opened files
  #- open/closed status of diagram toolbox
  #- window size
  #- reset tool option

#- When Stereotype has no submenu items, grey it out. Same goes for "Export"
  menu. This will be handled by the UIManager in the near future.

- disable actions when editing.

- write really good test cases for undo functionality. Have some already.

- An option that shows the selected item (in the namespace view) in a diagram.

- Stereotype export and import function. Allow to export packages and import
  them into other models.

#- Create distinctive icons for Include and Extend relationships (use cases).

- How to figure out if a module exists without loading it?

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI (work in progress),
  code, images (SVG/png), etc. - make a plugin!

- fix accelarators (HOW?), partially done, accelerators on items in popup menus
  does not work.
  Accelerators should be activated by the (Abstract)Window, should not depend
  on menu items. Intercept Window::key_pressed_event and let it handle
  popup menu actions.

- In some cases (like when editing attributes) Enter should be used to
  complete the edit action.

- Create a good algorithm for placement of lines and maybe nodes too.

- Use default GTK+ menu classes, in stead of the home-brew one.

- Use GTK+ 2.4 UIManager and ActionGroups (?):
  * Reconsider since GTK+ 2.8 bindings are fairly better than the 2.4 bindings
  . We have to keep the gaphor.misc.action module intact.
  . As far as I can see, cross action updates, are not supported.
  . Properties can be mapped in a straightforward way.
  . Should actions be split up: one for the main window, one group per
    diagram and one group per item type?
  . GtkUIManager looks useful, some structures in Gaphor may have to be
    reconsidered. What to do with AccelMaps for example. (I really have
    to read the tutorial some day ;-).
  . The current structure is simple and quite Pythonic. It should be this way.
  . Stuff like a recent-file box will be easier to create (I guess).
  Previous conclusion: keep using the gaphor.misc.action code

#- Storing last open files or having a quick-list of most important
  directories or so would be great 
  Problem: the existing <Placeholder> stuff works only on construction time.
    For this we need a menu that can change during the life of the application.

#- Make associations look nice with usecases:
   . No arrows at the end
   . Disable popup menu for navigability and composition

#- Automatically draw relations when an item is DND-ed from the tree-view
  to the diagram.

#- confirmation window when creating a new model.

#- Copy/Paste for diagramitems
  - in order to make copy/paste work, the load/save functions should be
    generatlised to allow a subset to be saved/loaded (which is needed
    anyway for exporting/importing stereotype Profiles).
  - How many data should be saved? (e.g. we copy a diagram item, remove it
    (the underlaying UML element is removed) and the paste the copied item.
    The diagram should act as if we have placed a copy of the removed item
    on the canvas and make the uml element visible again.

#- Undo/redo functionality

#- Make text selected when starting to edit it: fixed in DiaCanvas2

#- Stereotypes: check documentation page 581 (597 absolute). Fixed. An extra
   association has been created between Stereotype and Class, Interface and
   Package.

#- Set up a plugin architecture. Since the internals of gaphor are pretty
   modular, plugins should not be that hard. I'm very happy with the new one
   it is easy to program, yet powerful (due to the XML description file, which
   allows gaphor to check several dependencies upfront.

Diagram Items
=============
Gaphor does not need to support *all* diagram types, but at least some
functinality should be provided for those.

- Deployment diagram:
  . Node
  . Artifact
  . some relations
- Sequence diagram:
  . Life line
  . different message types
  . Interaction

- Lineup selected elements vertically, horizontally in context menu

- I also intend to "merge" lines (as is often used for generalizations: a
  line with one arrow, which splits into two lines, one for each subclass)

- The text editing also needs a facelift.

#- Alert a user when deleting the last reference to an object (Are you
  sure you want to remove all the selected elements from the model?)
