As always, there is much to do...

- Diagram items should be created for lots of model elements
  (we currently have Actor, UseCase, Comment and the fancy line that connects
   a comment with another model element). Also a buch of relationships are
   already implemented (Generalization, Include, Extend, Dependency).
   Next we should focus on the Association and then some static model elements
   like classes and packages.

- Overall user interface... I have some vague idea how to set it up, but
  I need someone with a little vision to create me a useable UI.

- Exporting diagrams to UML XMI, code, images (SVG/png), etc.

More specific:
- Popup menu's: they should be created through an ItemFactory, but what is
  the most easy interface for adding those items (esp. for plugins)
- Some logic about what classes can be connected to each other should be
  moved from the DiagramItems to the data elements.
- A more pattern driven design (using Factories, Singletons etc.)
- Notifiers that should tell the tree model to update.
