Gaphor is a UML and SysML modeling application written in Python.
It is designed to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture drawing tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.

## üìú Background

Gaphor is a UML and SysML modeling application written in Python. We designed
it to be easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a
fully-compliant UML 2 data model, so it is much more than a picture drawing
tool. You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as
well as create complete, highly complex models.

Gaphor is designed around the following principles:

- Simplicity: The application should be easy to use. Only some basic knowledge of UML or SysML is required.
- Consistency: UML is a graphical modeling language, so all modeling is done in a diagram.
- Workability: The application should not bother the user every time they do something non-UML-ish.

Gaphor is a GUI application. It has a modern [GTK](https://gtk.org)-based interface and uses
[Cairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) for consistent rendering.

Gaphor is a library.
You can use it from [scripts and Jupyter notebooks](https://docs.gaphor.org/en/latest/scripting.html)
and interact with models programmatically.

Non-Goals:

- Generating UML diagrams from source code. [pynsource](https://github.com/abulka/pynsource) or [pyreverse](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/tree/main/pylint/pyreverse) might be what you are looking for.
- Generating source code from diagrams or creating other concrete executable artifacts including use of fUML or ALF.

Although it would be possible to incorporate these features, these aren't the
goals of this project. However, if these are important capabilities for you,
you may be able to extend Gaphor by creating a
[plugin](https://docs.gaphor.org/en/latest/service_oriented.html#example-plugin).

## üíæ Install

<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/org.gaphor.Gaphor'><img alt='Download on Flathub' title='Download on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/api/badge?svg&locale=en'/></a>

You can find [the latest version](https://gaphor.org/download) on the
[gaphor.org website](https://gaphor.org/download). Gaphor ships installers for
macOS and Windows. Those can be found there. The Python package is also
[available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gaphor/).

All releases are available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/releases/).

If you want to start developing on Gaphor, have a look at the [Installation
section of our documentation](https://docs.gaphor.org/en/latest/).

## üî¶ Usage

If using Gaphor for the first time you will be presented with a greeter dialog
at startup in which you can select one of 5 models available to you to work in:
- **Generic:** (or blank) template
- **UML:** *Unified Modeling Language* template
- **SysML:** *Systems Modeling Language* template
- **RAAML:** *Risk Analysis and Assessment Modeling language* template
- **C4 Model:** *a lean graphical notation technique for modelling the architecture of software systems* template

After you select a template, the main Gaphor window will load, and you will be
ready to start modeling. Gaphor will automatically select the correct profile
based on the template that you selected, but you can also select other modeling
profiles if needed by clicking on the button next to the Profile dropdown menu
at the top of your window.

To select an element you want to place, for example a Class, click on the icon
in the Toolbox and then again on the diagram. This will place a new Class item
on the diagram and add a new Class to the model (it shows up in the
[Model Browser](https://docs.gaphor.org/en/latest/getting_started.html#model-browser)).

Portions of the toolbox may also be collapsed depending on the type of diagram
you are modeling with. You can expand the collapsed portions of the toolbox if
needed.

If you want to know more, please read our documentation on https://docs.gaphor.org.
