Introduction
============

Welcome to the Gaphor! 

Gaphor is a UML modelling application written in Python.  It is designed to be easy to use while not substituting completeness, that is, Gaphor implements a fully-compliant UML 2 data model.  You can use Gaphor to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as well as create complete, highly complex models.

Gaphor is designed around the following principles:

 1. ''Consistency''. UML is a graphical modelling language, so every aspect should be represented in a diagram[1]_.
 2. ''Simplicity''. The application should be easy to use. Only some basic knowledge of UML is required.
 3. ''Workability''. The application should not bother the user every time (s)he does something non-UML-ish.

This manual serves as a reference for all Gaphor as to offer.  So, you may read it from start to finish, or jump to a section that interests you.

.. _[1] We take this quite literally: even stereotypes are modelled in diagrams.
