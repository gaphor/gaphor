  *The source is the documentation.*

Well, not for us.

Currently, there's not a lot of documentation though. For those of you interested in Gaphor there's:

* A :doc:`manual <manual/index>`. It outlines some of the ideas in and behind Gaphor.
* The :ref:`tech-section` contains some interesting articles about the technology that drives Gaphor and Gaphas, Gaphor's canvas widget.

If you're into writing plug-ins for Gaphor you should have a look at our fabulous `Hello world <http://github.com/amolenaar/gaphor.plugins.helloworld>`_ plug-in.

  * The `UML diagrams <http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/umlDiagrams.htm>`_ (although Gaphor does not see it that black-and-white).

* The `official UML metamodel specification <http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/modeling_spec_catalog.htm#UML>`_. This ''is'' our data model.
