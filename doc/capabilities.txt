Gaphor capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One nice feature of user interfaces is the ability to disable options that
don't do anything useful in a specific context. For example: it's useles to
enable a 'undo' button when there's no information to undo.

To solve this two possible solutions can be provided:
  1. special listeners are installed to intercept state changes and act
  2. declarative: a (limited) set of 'capabilities' is provided. Each command
     supports one or more capabilities.


Standard capabilities:
  All UML metamodel classes can act as capability. Commands can only be
  useful for a limited set of data elements (for example for Namespace like
  elements). These capabilities can be assigned by giving the name of the
  elements(s) that can be affected using a command as a string ('Namespace').
  This option is most useful for popup menus.
  
Main window capabilities:
  Some actions are quite useless to do, like saving a model, while there is
  no model.
  For a start we will distinguish the following caps.:
  - 'element': there are model elements defined in the main element factory.

Diagram window capabilities:
  - 'focus': there is an item selected in a diagram and it has the focus.
  - 'select': one ot more items in the diagram are selected.
  - 'undo': there is undo information present in the diagram.
  - 'redo': there is redo information present in the diagram.
  
  DiagramItems can not be used as capability. The reason is that the UML
  model has a stable design, while the implementation of diagrams and diagram
  items is likely to change much often.
