Gaphor on Windows
=================

Gaphor even runs on windows. 

.. warning :: 

  The installer is currently broken. For now, use the alternative way
  as described below (see #128).

Download the installer: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gaphor/. 
This installer will download all required files and install them (you will
require an internet connection when running the installer).  

Alternative
-----------

Another way is to install the `all-in-one installer <http://osl.ulpgc.es/~arc/gnome/pygtk-setup.exe>`_ from `Alberto Ruiz <http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/12/allinone_win32_.html>`_. Running the PyGTK installer with default settings will install Python, GTK+ and PyGTK in ``C:\Program Files\PyGTK``.

After installing Python, PyGTK and the GTK+ runtime environment, you need to install `easy_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_. Download the latest version from `ez_setup.py <http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py ez_setup.py>`_ (place it in ``C:\Program Files\PyGTK`` for example) and run it: Open a command shell (''Start'' -> ''Run...'', type ``cmd`` (enter))::

   C:\>"c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\python.exe" "c:\Program Files\PyGTK\ez_setup.py"

After installing ``easy_install``, first install [http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zope.interface zope.interface]::

   C:\>"c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\Scripts\easy_install.exe" zope.interface==3.3.0

Here version 3.3.0 is installed (instead of the latest version). This is due 
to the fact that no binary distribution is available for the latest
``zope.interface`` module. No problem. Gaphor will work with an older
version of ``zope.interface`` too.

After a successful installation of ``zope.interface`` Gaphor should be installed by executing::

   C:\>"c:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\Scripts\easy_install.exe" gaphor

Now you should be able to start Gaphor my executing ``C:\Program Files\PyGTK\Python\Scripts\gaphor.py``. This work from within the explorer.


If you're a developer and already have Python 2.4 installed you can, as an
alternative, check out the ``gaphor-win32-libs`` module from Gaphors
subversion repository or download the zip file from http://svn.devjavu.com/gaphor/gaphor-win32-libs/zips/gaphor-win32-libs.zip.
Follow the instructions in the ``README.txt`` file.


Troubleshooting
---------------

You're getting an error message like this::

    error: Setup script exited with error: Python was built with Visual Studio 
    version 7.1, and extensions need to be built with the same version of the
    compiler, but it isn't installed.

This is due to the fact that no binary distribution is available for the
latest ``zope.interface`` module. Try to install an older version of zope.interface (see above).

My error is more like this::

    error: Setup script exited with error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory

Same reason as described above, you just performed the steps described on CustomInstallationLocation.
