"Abstraction is a way of simplifying complex systems by focusing on only "
"the most important details, while ignoring the rest. It's a process of "
"reducing complexity by removing unnecessary details and highlighting the "
"key aspects of a system in order to focus on the problem to be solved. It"
" is the key to rigorous analysis of a system."
msgstr ""

#: ../coffee_machine.md:58
msgid ""
"To understand abstraction, think about a painting. When you look at a "
"painting, you see a representation of something - perhaps a person, a "
"landscape, or an object. The artist has simplified the real world into a "
"set of lines, shapes, and colors that represent the most important "
"details of the subject. In the same way, systems engineers, like our "
"friends the ants, use abstraction to represent complex systems by "
"breaking them down into their essential components and highlighting the "
"most important aspects."
msgstr ""

#: ../coffee_machine.md:66
msgid ""
"Abstraction levels refer to the different levels of detail at which a "
"system can be represented. These levels are used to break down complex "
"systems into smaller, more manageable parts that can be analyzed and "
"optimized. Said another way, abstraction levels group portions of a "
"design where similar types of questions are answered."

"There are typically three levels of abstraction in systems engineering "

"Concept Level: Sometimes also called Conceptual Level. Defines the "
"problem being solved. This is the highest level of abstraction, where the"

"requirements and how it will interact with other systems."

msgstr ""

#: ../coffee_machine.md:89
