msgid "Abstraction is a way of simplifying complex systems by focusing on only the most important details, while ignoring the rest.

It is the key to rigorous analysis of a system."

#: ../coffee_machine.md:58
msgid "To understand abstraction, think about a painting. When you look at a painting, you see a representation of something - perhaps a person, a landscape, or an object. The artist has simplified the real world into a set of lines, shapes, and colors that represent the most important details of the subject. In the same way, systems engineers, like our friends the ants, use abstraction to represent complex systems by breaking them down into their essential components and highlighting the most important aspects."

"。在此层级中，重点关注的是系统实现的具体细节。"

#: ../coffee_machine.md:89
msgid "Each level of abstraction provides a different perspective on the system, and each level is important for different aspects of system design and analysis.
