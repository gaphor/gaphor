Introduction
============

Welcome to the Gaphor! 

Gaphor is a UML modeling application written in Python. It is designed to be
easy to use, while still being powerful. Gaphor implements a fully-compliant UML
2 data model, so it is much more than a picture drawing tool. You can use Gaphor
to quickly visualize different aspects of a system as well as create complete,
highly complex models.

Gaphor is designed around the following principles:

- Simplicity
  The application should be easy to use. Only some basic knowledge of UML is required.
- Consistency
  UML is a graphical modeling language, so all modeling is done in a diagram [#f1]_ .
- Workability
  The application should not bother the user every time they do something non-UML-ish.

This manual serves as a reference for all Gaphor has to offer.  So, you may read it from start to finish, or jump to a section that interests you.


.. [#f1] We take this quite literally: even stereotypes are modeled in diagrams.
