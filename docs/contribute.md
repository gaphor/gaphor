# Contribute to Gaphor

Would you like to contribute to the development of Gaphor? If you think this is only something for experienced
developers, please reconsider, there are plenty of ways to contribute to Gaphor, no matter your level of experience or
skill set.

You can help to support Gaphor in your language. You can do that on
[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/gaphor/), directly from your browser. This service will periodically create
[Pull
Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
for Gaphor with updated translations.

It is also very nice if you create your own content around Gaphor. Think about blog posts, videos, and conference talks.
When you created something, please drop us a line, so we can add it to the [Tutorials](https://gaphor.org/tutorials)
page on the website.

If you want to contribute code, a good starting point is this site. It contains a lot of information on how Gaphor is
build, especially in the *Concepts* section.

Some issues are labeled with *first-timers-only*. Those issues are a good starting point to make yourself familiar with
the code and code style.

It's always a good idea to create an [issue](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/issues) or start a
[discussion](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor/discussions) if you want to build something for which there is no issue
yet. That way you can assure that your idea is implemented in a way consistent with the application, and it increases
the chance your work will be accepted.

You'll need to
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) Gaphor
and set up a [development environment](linux.md) ([macOS](macos.md), [Windows](windows.md)).

```{note}
In our pipeline we do a couple of quality checks. We strongly recommend that you [install
pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and its git hook scripts, so your PR does build on our build environment.
```
