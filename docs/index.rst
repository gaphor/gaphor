The Gaphor Technical Documentation
==================================

This documentation is aimed at those who would be interested in making
contributions to Gaphor. For tutorials and how-to information, please visit the
`Gaphor Website <https://gaphor.org>`_.

In the future, we would like to split the documentation in to sections that
focus on **explanation** (understanding-oriented) and **reference**
(information-oriented). For now, this information is all together.

If you're into writing plug-ins for Gaphor you should have a look at our
fabulous `Hello world <https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor.plugins.helloworld>`_
plug-in.

  1. `UML Diagrams <http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/umlDiagrams.htm>`_ (although Gaphor does not see it that black-and-white).
